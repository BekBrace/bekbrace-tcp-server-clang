# Simple C Socket Server

This is a basic C program that demonstrates the implementation of a simple socket server. 

The program creates a socket, binds it to a specified port, and listens for incoming connections. When a connection is accepted, it reads data from the client and prints it.

## Prerequisites

Make sure you have a C compiler installed on your system, such as GCC.

```bash
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install build-essential
